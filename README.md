## Intro to HTML and CSS
Couple month ago I had won as a prise <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/courses/246">HTML/CSS course</a> so I can say that I had recognized a bit about <a href="https://github.com/t-jay-777/kottans-frontend/blob/master/html_css_intro/geekbrains_html_css_basic.en.pdf" title="Certificate">web-page design</a>. But I had found <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru" title="htmlacademy.ru">here</a> also much useful information for me: tables, selectors, page markup etc.<br>
It was so interesting, that I forgot about 2 free chapters and I don't know how could pass more.<br>

Extra material also are in my learning process. I will try to get certification <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" title="freecodecamp.org">here</a>.
## Git Collaboration
In 0 stage of general basics of the course I had been learned about git and GitHub and I spend much time to learn not provided extra material on this topic. But here I found smth new also. In many problems I look from a different angle and I had a good practice to make remote repos and interact with them. Anyway there exist plenty more information about git what I should know and of course **practice and more an more practice**

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
This part of the cource I past fast because during my learning previous part about Git and Git Hub I had learned plenty extra materials what included Linux comand line also.
	
About HTTP protocol I found out a bit during my learning course SC50 (Ukrainian adoption on prometheus.org). Provided article is great for content but it hard for understanding for begginer.Thats great that Ukrainian version exists.
	
Also I spend some time for extra materials.

As I understand I add some screenshots of Linux Survival course:<br>
