## JS Basics
<p>I finished to learn JavaScript basic. During the challenge I find out much new js features. Also it was good coding practice for me. This chalenge motivate me to learn deeper about algorithms. I have started some lessons.</p>
<h4>1. Intro to JS (Udemy)</h4>
<p>I thought it will be easy for me because I mentioned I know some javascript basics, but it it turned out that I know only very basics.<br> Conditions and loops I catch very fast. It was hard to understand recursive functions and I still feel not familiar with them. In my algorithms lessons I try to pay more attention for this problem. It makes code like art üòé.<br>
Arrays and objects explosured my brain. Thats why it is interesting. Thats why I feel I should to tame this great powerfull tool üí™.</p><br>

<h4>FreeCodeCamp exercises</h4>
<p>Basic JavaScript I passed quite easy. I did't feel some problems.<br>
During ES6 challenge I was confused because I had not know about what kinds of changes used to be with JS language. I had not so much practice with previous versions of JS. I find out what difference between <i>let</i>, <i>var</i> and <i>const</i>. I met arrow functions, template literal, "strict mode", <i>Object.freeze</i>, class keywords, promise constructor function, then and catch methods and plenty new for me üòµ. </p>
<p>I decided not to jump from task to task but tried to pass all chapters one by one to reach described challenges.</p>
<p>Another big topic what I learned is regular expressions pattern. Truly say, I still can't undestand it.<br>Different flags, character sets, like <q>[^ \r\t\f\n\v]</q>, make you brain upload ‚ùóÔ∏è .</p>
<p>In <i>Basic Data Strure</i> section I learned deeper object and arrays.</p>
<p>In <i>Basic Algorithm Scripting</i> I solved some small problems which become more serious in <i>Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges</i>.</p>
<p><i>Functional Programming</i> is an object oriented programming organizes code into object definitions.<br> I learned here that the object structure makes it flexible within a program.
Objects can transfer information by calling and passing data to another object's methods.
Objects can have a special type of property, called a method.</p>
<p>And finally I really got stuck at <i>Algorithm Scripting Challenges</i>. I honestly tried to solve it by myself but many times google helped meüòä. Sometimes I used hints incide this challenges. But I felt myself really great when I solved that problems without help. </p>

I spent a lot of time learning some extra matherials(like <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/introduction_to_programming" target="_blank">haxlet<a/>):<br>

## HTML & CSS practice: Hooli-style Popup
This task was first with some kind of practice. I deside use Grid method combining it with Flex.<br>
First of all I did looked at mockup that page is not difficult and it needs only one list with main-manu and also one or two sublists for popup menu. Main menu had been done pretty fast and it start to be difficult when I tried to do popup menu. Pseudo element **::before** helped to do it what I learned while the task had being doing. Also another pseudoelements I used to complete the task.
As I had some problems before pushing this task to github I made some extra <a href="https://github.com/t-jay-777/popup-style-menu" target="_blank">repo</a>.

## Responsive Web Design
While I had been passing <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893">Responsive Web Design</a> I found in extra matherials link to <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882">Responsive Images</a> course. I guess both them should be learned. I had known about responsive web design but I hadn't imaged all this problem. In my training projects I tried do smth "responsive" but after the courses I know this problem much better. I found out a lot about @media queries, relative measures, <picture></picture>, templates and many other things. Some meta datas could help make responsive design also. I learned some technics how to do **adoptive** design. Now I understand better how to manage images in my future projects. I should pay more attention for img formats. Also I found out the power of fonts, CSS background images, icons, svg images. I know now about such powerful tools like **srcset** and **sizes**(attribute). All problems showed in this two courses were interesting and I spend more time to learn that deep.<br>

<br> This problem will learned much more by me :blush:.<br>
Games <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/#ru">FLEXBOX FROGGY</a> and <a href="https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/">Grid Garden</a> were interestig also and helped me to understand a bit flexbox and grid.<br>

Unfortunatelly I cant say it about <a href="https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies">Flexbox Zombies</a>.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
Couple month ago I had won as a prise <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/courses/246">HTML/CSS course</a> so I can say that I had recognized a bit about <a href="https://github.com/t-jay-777/kottans-frontend/blob/master/html_css_intro/geekbrains_html_css_basic.en.pdf" title="Certificate">web-page design</a>. But I had found <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru" title="htmlacademy.ru">here</a> also much useful information for me: tables, selectors, page markup etc.<br>
It was so interesting, that I forgot about 2 free chapters and I don't know how could pass more.<br>

But I'm glad of it. Some information are refreshed and some are new for me.<br>
Udacity course is for very begginers<br>
<img src="html_css_intro/udacity_intro_to_html_css.png" width="20%"><br>
Extra material also are in my learning process. I will try to get certification <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" title="freecodecamp.org">here</a>.

## Git Collaboration
In 0 stage of general basics of the course I had been learned about git and GitHub and I spend much time to learn not provided extra material on this topic. But here I found smth new also. In many problems I look from a different angle and I had a good practice to make remote repos and interact with them. Anyway there exist plenty more information about git what I should know and of course **practice and more an more practice**
Some screenshots after tasked cources:<br>

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
This part of the cource I past fast because during my learning previous part about Git and Git Hub I had learned plenty extra materials what included Linux comand line also.
	
About HTTP protocol I found out a bit during my learning course SC50 (Ukrainian adoption on prometheus.org). Provided article is great for content but it hard for understanding for begginer.Thats great that Ukrainian version exists.
	
Also I spend some time for extra materials.

As I understand I add some screenshots of Linux Survival course:<br>

Wow! 
I've learnt just some lessons about Git... It is both simple and hard imlement. Much left to find out more but basics are done.
