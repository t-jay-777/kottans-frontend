##HTML & CSS practice: Hooli-style Popup
This task was first with some kind of practice. I deside use Grid method combining it with Flex.<br>
First of all I did looked at mockup that page is not difficult and it needs only one list with main-manu and also one or two sublists for popup menu. Main menu had been done pretty fast and it start to be difficult when I tried to do popup menu. Pseudo element **::before** helped to do it what I learned while the task had being doing. Also another pseudoelements I used to complete the task. 
## Responsive Web Design
While I had been passing <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893">Responsive Web Design</a> I found in extra matherials link to <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882">Responsive Images</a> course. I guess both them should be learned. I had known about responsive web design but I hadn't imaged all this problem. In my training projects I tried do smth "responsive" but after the courses I know this problem much better. I found out a lot about @media queries, relative measures, <picture></picture>, templates and many other things. Some meta datas could help make responsive design also. I learned some technics how to do **adoptive** design. Now I understand better how to manage images in my future projects. I should pay more attention for img formats. Also I found out the power of fonts, CSS background images, icons, svg images. I know now about such powerful tools like **srcset** and **sizes**(attribute). All problems showed in this two courses were interesting and I spend more time to learn that deep.<br>

## Intro to HTML and CSS
Couple month ago I had won as a prise <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/courses/246">HTML/CSS course</a> so I can say that I had recognized a bit about <a href="https://github.com/t-jay-777/kottans-frontend/blob/master/html_css_intro/geekbrains_html_css_basic.en.pdf" title="Certificate">web-page design</a>. But I had found <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru" title="htmlacademy.ru">here</a> also much useful information for me: tables, selectors, page markup etc.<br>
It was so interesting, that I forgot about 2 free chapters and I don't know how could pass more.<br>

## Git Collaboration
In 0 stage of general basics of the course I had been learned about git and GitHub and I spend much time to learn not provided extra material on this topic. But here I found smth new also. In many problems I look from a different angle and I had a good practice to make remote repos and interact with them. Anyway there exist plenty more information about git what I should know and of course **practice and more an more practice**
Some screenshots after tasked cources:<br>

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
This part of the cource I past fast because during my learning previous part about Git and Git Hub I had learned plenty extra materials what included Linux comand line also.
	
About HTTP protocol I found out a bit during my learning course SC50 (Ukrainian adoption on prometheus.org). Provided article is great for content but it hard for understanding for begginer.Thats great that Ukrainian version exists.
	
Also I spend some time for extra materials.

As I understand I add some screenshots of Linux Survival course:<br>
