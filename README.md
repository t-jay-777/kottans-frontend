## Linux CLI, and HTTP
	This part of the cource I past fast because during my learning previous part about Git and Git Hub I had learned plenty extra materials what included Linux comand line also.
	
	About HTTP protocol I found out a bit during my learning course SC50 (Ukrainiann adoption on prometheus.org). Provided article is great for content but it hard for understanding for begginer.Thats great that Ukrainian version  exists.
	
	Also I spend some time for extra materials.
